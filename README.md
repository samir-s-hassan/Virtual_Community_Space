# WEB103 Project 3 - Virtual Community Space

Submitted by: Samir Hassan

About this web app: Virtual Community Space is a web app built to showcase events happening across different locations. Using React, the app connects to a PostgreSQL database hosted on Railway, making it easy to fetch and display event details in real time. Users can explore various event locations, check out whatâ€™s happening at each spot, and enjoy unique pages dedicated to every location.

Time spent: 3 hours

## Notes

- For the Events page, I can't find a way to properly layout all the Events in a grid. The CSS was very difficult for this one.
- Next time, since the front-end code was provided to us, I'll match the frontend data template to my backend data.
